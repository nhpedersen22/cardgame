                <p>
                    CSH: The Card Game is a party game for two to eight people where your goal is to build up the most votes by the Election and become the Chairperson. Each person plays as one of the eight CSH Directorships, which introduces new cards into the playing deck. Each turn, the player has two actions, which can be used for either drawing and playing. Cards are played into the Archive, which has seven slots. The game ends immediately when the Election Card is drawn. The winner is decided after everyone totals the Voting Power in their Archive, the player with the highest Voting Power wins the Election to be the Chairperson, thus winning the game!

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            There are eight CSH Directorships, with ten cards per Directorship, and each introduces new cards into the Deck. These are shuffled in with the Base cards. Each Directorship has a distinct playstyle:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Evals - Gives the highest Voting Power, but without special abilities.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Socials - The voting power is equal to the amount of Social cards in play.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    PR - Manipulates cards by drawing extra, stealing cards, & making people discard cards.

                                <li>
                                    R&D - Gives you advantageous upgrades.
                                </li>

                                    OpComm - Manipulates the deck and draws extra cards.

                                    History - Manipulates cards in Archives.

                                    Financials - Controls the flow of the game and alters players&#39; turns.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                        <p>
                            The purpose of choosing a Directorship is to add different cards to the Deck. Choosing a Directorship does not give any advantage.

                                    Each player chooses a unique Directorship.

                                    Take out the Election Card, then shuffle the Base cards with the cards of each of the Directorships that were chosen. This becomes the Deck. Discard the Directorship cards that were not chosen.

                                    Take out the last ten cards from the Deck. Shuffle the Election Card with these cards, and put them back at the bottom of the Deck.

                            The Archive is the play area in front of you where all your cards are played into. It can hold a maximum of seven Stacks of cards. A Stack is one or more cards. The only way to create multi-card Stacks is to place a Directorship card on top of a Base card.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once a player&#39;s Archive is full, they cannot play another card in their Archive without removing a Stack.
                        </p>

                            On your turn, you must take two Actions. An Action is either a Draw Action (where you draw one card from the Deck), or a Play Action (where you play one card into your Archive unless otherwise specified).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The effect of a card triggers upon entering an Archive. It will fully resolve if no other cards are played in response, such as “Cancel” or “Spending Presentation”. If a card is played in response, that card&#39;s effect resolves first.

                        <p>
                            The Election Card marks the end of the game. It is placed face down within the last ten cards of the Deck.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the Election Card is drawn, the game ends immediately (no more Actions can be taken by any player). Players add up the totals of the cards in their Archive, and the player with the greatest sum wins the game, and is elected Chair.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If there is a tie, the player with the most cards in their Archive wins. If there is still a tie, the person who can name the most operating systems wins.

                    <h3>Special Rules:</h3>

                    <div class="content">
                        <div>
                            <h4>Cards:</h4>
                            <p>
                                No cards can be played underneath other cards in an Archive. Base cards cannot be played on top of any cards.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <h4>Freshmen:</h4>
                            <p>
                                Freshmen can be stacked on top of each other, and played together as if they were one card. Freshmen only act as a single Base card for the purposes of playing them together.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, you can play three Freshmen cards into one Stack for one Play Action, or add two Freshmen cards to four Freshmen cards already in a Stack.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                Cancel has to be played in reaction to another card being played. Cancels can be Canceled. Canceled cards are flipped over, and they get a voting power of 0 and no card effect, but remain in your Archive. A Canceled card cannot have any cards played on top of it.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                You cannot remove a Stack with a negative total Voting Power, unless there are at least two cards in that Stack.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                If you have no cards in your hand, the next time you use a Draw Action, you may instead draw three cards, and skip the rest of your turn.

            <p>
                This game was made possible thanks to the hard work of Igor Polotai, James Hansplant, Nathan Pedersen, Mel Fangmann, Bora Zihnali, as well as the playtesters Joseph Isaac, Charlotte George, Nathan Russo, Andrew Steven-Hernandez, and everyone else in CSH!
