            <p>The CSH Card Game was created during the 2023-24 academic year.</p>
            <p>
                This game was made possible thanks to the hard work of Igor Polotai, James Hansplant, Nathan Pedersen, Mel Fangmann, Bora Zihnali, as well as the playtesters Joseph Isaac, Charlotte George, Nathan Russo, Andrew Steven-Hernandez, and everyone else in CSH!
